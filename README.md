# This is a simple script that will let you know if a product is located near your postal code

1. Make sure you have a working BestBuy [API key](https://developer.bestbuy.com/).
2. Go to [BestBuy](https://www.bestbuy.com/) and find the product SKU of whatever it is that you'd like to search.
3. You should have the zip code of the region you would like to search.
4. After replacing data with your variables, run the following command: `python3 main.py $API_KEY $POSTAL_CODE $PRODUCT_SKU`
